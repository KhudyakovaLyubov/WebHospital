## Technologies in the project

Added an element for easy date and time selection:
~~~
<form method="post" action="@Url.Action("CreateReception", "Reception")">
    @using (Html.BeginForm())
    {
        @Html.LabelFor(model => model.Employee, "Врач")
        <br />
        @Html.DropDownListFor(model => model.Employee, ViewBag.employees as SelectList, new { @class = "form-control" })
        <br />
        <br />
        @Html.LabelFor(model => model.Patient, "Пациент")
        <br />
        @Html.DropDownListFor(model => model.Patient, ViewBag.patients as SelectList, new { @class = "form-control" })
        <br />
        <br />
        @Html.LabelFor(model => model.LogInDate, "Дата")
        <br />
        @Html.EditorFor(model => model.LogInDate, new { htmlAttributes = new { @class = "form-control", @type = "date" } })
        <br />
        <br />
        @Html.LabelFor(model => model.LogInTime, "Время")
        <br />
        @Html.EditorFor(model => model.LogInTime, new { htmlAttributes = new { @class = "form-control", @type = "time" } })
        <br />
        <br />
        <input type="submit" class="btn btn-primary" value="Добавить" />
    }
</form>
~~~
By including the type attributes in EditFor (), the datetimepicker from bootstrap is displayed.

## Description

At the moment, the project is in its initial state, and a range of tasks has been calculated for further work:
* introduction of the personal account (with the separation of access rights); 
* more convenient transition to editing, adding records;
* deleting records without first going to the delete page;
* introduction of addresses by section;
* adding a shift calendar for doctors;
* only an authorized user will be able to add appointment entries;
* when you enter the main page, you will see a nice structure of departments with the choice of a doctor and when you select a doctor, you will switch to the shift calendar to reserve a ticket for an appointment with a doctor.
